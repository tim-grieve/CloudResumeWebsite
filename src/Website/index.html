  <h3><a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">Cloud Resume Challenge - https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/</a></h3>
  <li>Objective: Publish your resume to a website including a javascript hit counter. Use serverless applications, infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines.</li>

    <li>Cloud Platform: AWS</li>
    
    <li>Frontend : Utilized Terraform configurations to deploy html, css and javascript code to an S3 bucket which was then securely published to an https website using an CloudFront distribution.</li>
    
    <li>Backend: Utilized Terraform configurations to deploy an Lambda function using a python script to retrieve and increment the count of site hits from a DynamoDB table. The functionality was then made accessible to the frontend website via and HTTP API published with API Gateway</li>
    
    <li>Both frontend and backend deployments are managed by a GitHub Actions YAML workflow which runs tests then initiates a pull request to the main branch to deploy changes to production.</li>
